STEPS
 - Variables initialization
        - Standard
        - Improve by: not hardcoding nFields
 - Read problem data
        - Standard
 - Create quadrature
        - Already was fine
 - Create dimensions
        - Should be fine
 - Create material
        - Inherited
        - Pretty much empty when created
        - Filled later on when computing variables (stiffness matrix)
 - Create interpolation
        - Already was fine
 - Create boundary conditions
 - Create solver

###

 - Compute variables
        - Use integrators to calculate LHS
        - Calculate the forces + reduced force matrix
        - Use solvers to solve

Ideas
 - Workflow:
        - Similar to TopOpt?
            - meh, widely different

 - Remove DOF? Merge it with mesh + dimensions + boundary conditions?

 - Follow-up question: What is a mesh?
    - Collection of nodes + connectivities?
    - Collection of DOFs?
    - Collection of nodes + DOFs?
    - Collection of nodes that can yield DOFs when required? <---

 - Return to the original classes and division?
